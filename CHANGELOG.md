# Changelog

## 0.4.0

**Breaking: tor-js now connects through gateways over [KPS](https://github.com/privacy-ethereum/kps) instead of WebSocket/WebRTC.** A 0.4.0 client requires a KPS gateway and cannot talk to a pre-0.4.0 gateway (or vice versa).

- **`gateway` is now a KPS address, not a URL.** Pass `ip:port:certhash` (printed by the gateway at startup), e.g. `198.51.100.7:12298:uEiAxk…9Qw`, instead of `https://…`. The client dials it over WebRTC in browsers and QUIC in Node.js (via the optional `@kpstreams/quic-client` peer dependency); relay connections are HTTP `CONNECT` tunnels on KPS streams.
- **Fast bootstrap moved to zstd** (`/bootstrap.zip.zst`), decompressed inside the WASM.
- **`ArtiSocket` is now stream-shaped** (`readable`/`writable`) rather than event-based, preserving backpressure end to end. This affects custom `socketProvider` implementations.
- Updated Arti to 2.5.0 (tor-* 0.44).
- The repository is now a monorepo: the KPS gateway lives in `crates/tor-js-gateway/`, and the website in `website/`.

### Migrating from 0.3.x

Replace your gateway URL with the gateway's KPS address, and run a KPS gateway (see [`crates/tor-js-gateway/`](crates/tor-js-gateway/)):

```js
// 0.3.x
new TorClient({ gateway: 'https://tor-js-gateway.example.com' });
// 0.4.0
new TorClient({ gateway: '198.51.100.7:12298:uEiAxk…9Qw' });
```
